# RUST Exercise

## 1. Calculator: 
- ### Level 1: 
   Write a simple calculator program that takes two decimal numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and prints the result. Handle division by zero appropriately. Example : “212 + 24” result: 236
- ### Level 2:
    same as Level 2 but with multiple operands. There will be an order in which the operands will be performed. Example: “212 + 24 * 2 - 76”
- ### Level 3: 
    Do simplification problems. Level 2 with parentheses. Ex: (5 + 3 * 3) - (2 + 2)
## 2. Fibonacci:
Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. Use a loop to calculate the result. Also use recursion.
## 3. Temperature Converter:
Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The user should specify the input temperature and the conversion direction.
## 4. Sum of Even Numbers:
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the array.
```
Input: 1 2 4 2 7 0 3
Output: 8
```
## 5. Student Struct:
Define a struct to represent a student with fields for name, age, and grade. Write a function that takes a vector of students and prints the names of all students who are 18 years old or older.


## 7. Factorial:
Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer n. Also use a loop.
